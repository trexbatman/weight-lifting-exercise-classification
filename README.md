# Weight Lifting Exercise Classification

## Background & Goals

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants were used to classify how well other 20 participants performed their Weight Lifting Exercise. <br> The exercise was performed in five different ways: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E). <br> More information about the data used in this project is available at: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
